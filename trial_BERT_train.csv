1,American gold and silver caused at least part of the European price revolution.
1,"And even in Spain, in times when money was scarcer, saleable goods and labour were given for very much less than after the discovery of the Indies, which flooded the country with gold and silver."

1,"But, from the Akan forest of the south much of the gold ceased to flow north and reached the Europeans on the Gold Coast. This change was associated with the rise of Asante, which used its economic resources and military prowess to dominate the immediate savanna hinterland."
1,"By the 1850s the Nyamwezi, like the Swahili- Arabs, had become large-scale caravan operators in East Africa Their major trading partner was Kazembe, from which they bought ivory and Katanga copper."

1,"By the end of the eighteenth century, copper came from the mines south of Darfur right across to Kano, and cloth  passed from Bornu to Wadai."
1,"By the seventeenth century, however,  a growing volume  of the  A k an gold had been diverted  to the European factories  on the G o ld Coast. This change in the pattern of the trade was associated with  the rise of Asante, which began  to press northwards about 1670."
1,"Certainly Sri Lanka was known to Arab and other traders long before Islam, being a source of precious stones, pearls from the Gulf of Mannar , between south-east India and Sri Lanka, and cinnamon, and serving as a convenient way station for east–west and vice versa trade."
1,"Chinese copper cash became the basic currency of Java, Malaya, and Maluku  during the fifteenth century."
1,"Chinese goods  and copper cash con- tinued to flow into Java; Mediterranean gold moved through  the Middle East and India to Java, along with major export items from these regions."

1,Eventually copper crosses from Katanga were being traded right through to Benguela.
1,"Exports from the Seville ports complex to America, most of which were paid for in silver, were in a rough correspondence to treasure imports, so it is no surprise to find that the official export of Spanish and European goods peaks about the same time."
1,"For a time the flow of slaves was reversed, as Lunda sold slaves eastward to the Luba in return for ivory, but this too was a short-lived phenomenon."
1,"For example, during this era the Chinese were aware that they could get a superior variety of pepper  in the Sunda Strait region, but did not bother to go there since it had a reputation for brigandage."
1,For most of the second half of the century this route carried Sumatran pepper through the Red Sea to Alexandria in quantities at least as large as the Portuguese were taking from India to western Europe.
1,"From being mainly pro- ducers, who sold to the established caravancers from Kasanje and Bihe, the Chokwe became traders who fetched their ivory from the middle Kasai and eventually from among the Luba."

Dagomba influence extended southward along this route to the point where the Black Volta  river, flowing from west to east, marked the border between the woodland savanna and the fringes of the forest. As early as the sixteenth century, commercial centres had developed on the northern bank of the Black Volta."
1,"He hoped in this way to cut the economic lifeline of his enemy, as silk was at that time the main article exported by Persia to the West and, therefore, the main source of the country's silver and gold revenue."

1,"In the late 186os King Munza, after demonstrating his military power, was able to receive the first Khartoum ivory traders peacefully and on his own terms.

1,"In the Potosi silver mines of Peru, production, although it never reached the peaks it had attained in the late sixteenth century, kept up reasonably well until the 1650s, aided in part by Madrid's willingness to give Peru priority over New Spain in the allocation of mercury exports from Europe which helped to supplement the faltering native supplies from the mines of Huancavelica To keep the mines producing, however, was an increasingly costly business."

1,"Indeed, its major port cities, of which Calicut was the most important from the sixth/ twelfth century, not only funnelled pepper from the interior towards distant markets, but also was a major transhipment port, where goods from further east, west and north, as far as China and Europe, were landed, broken up and sold, and sent on to their markets."
1,Moroccan officials who returned from the Sudan brought many camel loads of gold with them.
1,"Never- theless, the war resolved, as Jameson had opined, the' uncertainty' which was devaluing Chartered shares, removed an obstacle to the flow of Shona labour, and opened access to the reputedly rich Ndebele gold-fields."

1,"One desert  route swung west to join the great Fezzan-Tripoli road; attempts to open an alternative road were made vigorously in the nineteenth century, and were eventually successful, though at considerable cost.  There were certainly commercial elements interwoven with  the development of Wadai's foreign links, and copper may well have played an important part."

1,"This is a significant  remark, for it indicates the predominance of  gold in the northbound  trade to Morocco, and of slaves in the westbound trade to the European factories, which failed to  divert the bulk of the gold of Bambuk and Bure from its old established route to the north."
